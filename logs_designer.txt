Perfect! I've successfully created a new feature idea file for **Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP)** at `0_ideas/automatic_mixed_precision.md`.

## Summary

**Feature Created:** Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP)

**Location:** `0_ideas/automatic_mixed_precision.md`

**Selected from:** Section 6.1 of `trajectory.md`

The feature idea covers:
- **Automatic Casting Engine** - Smart dtype conversion based on operation safety
- **Loss Scaling System** - Dynamic and static scaling for numerical stability
- **GradScaler API** - High-level and low-level APIs for training loops
- **Op Precision Registry** - Extensible system for custom operations

This is a critical ML framework feature that provides 2-8x performance speedup and memory efficiency while maintaining model accuracy. The file includes comprehensive technical requirements for C# implementation, API design examples, integration points, use cases, and success criteria.

The `trajectory.md` file has been updated to mark this feature as selected.
