I'll help you generate a new feature idea. Let me first check the trajectory.md file and the 0_ideas/ directory to understand the context and format.

I can see the 0_ideas/ directory is empty. Looking at trajectory.md, I'll select an unselected feature for implementation. I found that "Custom Autograd Functions" hasn't been selected yet, which is a critical feature for a machine learning framework.

Let me create a feature idea file for Custom Autograd Functions:
[92m[1m| [0m[90m Write    [0m0_ideas\custom_autograd_functions.md
Now I need to mark this feature as selected in trajectory.md:
[92m[1m| [0m[90m Edit     [0mtrajectory.md
Done! I've created a new feature idea file for **Custom Autograd Functions** in `0_ideas/custom_autograd_functions.md` and marked it as selected in trajectory.md.

This feature allows users to define custom forward and backward passes for operations that:
- Are numerically unstable and need careful gradient computation
- Are non-differentiable by default (requiring techniques like straight-through estimator)
- Need performance optimization beyond what automatic tracing provides
- Implement novel research ideas or custom loss functions

The file includes detailed technical specifications, API design, example use cases (STEBinary, StableSoftmax, ClampedMSELoss), and a comprehensive testing strategy.
