I'll help you generate a new feature idea. Let me first check if there's a trajectory.md file to see what features might be planned.

I can see the trajectory.md file contains a comprehensive roadmap. Looking at it, I notice that **Pipeline Parallelism** (line 95) is a critical feature that hasn't been selected yet. This is essential for training large models that need to be split across multiple devices vertically by layers.

Let me create a feature idea file for Pipeline Parallelism:

[92m[1m| [0m[90m Edit     [0mtrajectory.md
Done! I've created **one** new feature idea file: `0_ideas/pipeline_parallelism.md`

This feature covers **Pipeline Parallelism**, a critical distributed training strategy that splits large models vertically across devices by layers. The file includes:

- **Core requirements**: Layer partitioning, micro-batching, communication scheduling, and asynchronous execution
- **Implementation details**: Scheduling strategies (1F1B, Interleaved), C# API components, communication interfaces
- **Memory optimization**: Activation checkpointing, offloading, gradient accumulation
- **Integration**: Compatibility with tensor parallelism, distributed optimizers, and mixed precision
- **Success metrics**: Throughput, memory efficiency, bubble time minimization

I've also marked this feature as selected in `trajectory.md` (line 95) with the checkmark notation.
