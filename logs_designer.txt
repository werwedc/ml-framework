I'll help you generate a new feature idea. Let me first check the `trajectory.md` file and the current state of the `0_ideas/` directory to understand the context and format.

I can see the trajectory.md file has many features, some marked as selected and others not. Let me identify an unmarked feature and create a new feature idea file. Looking at the trajectory, I notice that "Model Zoos" is not yet marked as selected. Let me create a feature idea file for this.

Perfect! I've successfully created **exactly one** new feature idea file:

✅ **Created**: `0_ideas/model_zoo.md`

This feature idea outlines a comprehensive Model Zoo system for the C# ML framework, including:

- Model repository management with versioning
- Model loading API with transfer learning support
- Automatic download and caching system
- Integration with external model hubs (Hugging Face, TensorFlow Hub, etc.)
- Search and discovery capabilities
- Benchmarking and comparison tools

✅ **Updated**: `trajectory.md` - Marked "Model Zoos" as selected with reference to the new idea file.

The task is complete. As per your instructions, I've created exactly ONE new feature idea file in `0_ideas/` and stopped immediately.
