I'll help you generate a new feature idea. Let me first check if trajectory.md exists to see what features might be available.

I can see trajectory.md contains many features, and several are marked as selected. I'll pick **Continuous Batching** (line 174) which is not yet selected - it's a critical feature for efficient LLM serving.

Let me create the feature idea file:

Now let me mark this feature as selected in trajectory.md:

✓ **Task Complete**

I've created a new feature idea file: `0_ideas/continuous_batching.md`

**Feature Selected:** Continuous Batching (Iteration-Level Scheduling)

This feature enables dynamic request management for LLM serving, allowing new requests to join an ongoing batch during token generation rather than waiting for batch completion. This provides:

- **2-5x higher throughput** for mixed workloads
- **20-40% reduction** in per-token latency
- **80-95% GPU utilization** (vs 40-60% in static batching)

The feature has been marked as selected in trajectory.md (line 174) and is ready for the Architect to specify the implementation details.
