✓ Created feature idea file: `0_ideas/mixed_precision_optimizer.md`

The file proposes a **Mixed-Precision Training Optimizer** that automatically manages FP16/BF16 and FP32 tensor operations for accelerated training while maintaining numerical stability. This is a valuable feature for modern ML frameworks that can provide:

- 2-3x training speedup on compatible hardware
- 40-50% reduction in GPU memory usage
- Support for larger batch sizes and model architectures

The proposal includes detailed architecture design, API specifications, implementation details, and risk mitigations.
