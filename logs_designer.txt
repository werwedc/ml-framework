I'll help you create a new feature idea for the ML framework. Let me first check the trajectory.md file and the current project structure.

I can see the trajectory.md file has many features, and the 0_ideas/ directory is currently empty. Let me check what exists in the project and pick an unselected feature to create as an idea file.

I can see the 0_ideas/ directory is empty and trajectory.md has many features. Looking through the document, I found an unselected feature for robust error reporting and debugging aids. Let me create a new feature idea file for this.

Perfect! I've created a comprehensive feature idea file for "Shape Mismatch Error Reporting" in `0_ideas/shape_mismatch_error_reporting.md`. Now let me mark this feature as selected in the trajectory.md file:

✅ **Task Complete!**

I've created a new feature idea file in `0_ideas/shape_mismatch_error_reporting.md` focusing on enhanced error reporting for tensor shape mismatches in the ML framework.

**Feature Overview:**
The idea proposes a comprehensive shape mismatch diagnostic system that provides:
- Detailed shape information with exact dimension sizes
- Contextual, human-readable error messages
- Layer-specific diagnostics showing where the error occurred
- Common pattern detection with suggested fixes
- Optional shape visualization

This addresses a critical pain point in deep learning development where opaque shape mismatch errors cause significant debugging delays. The enhanced error system will dramatically improve developer experience and reduce time spent debugging shape-related issues.

The feature has been marked as selected in `trajectory.md` and is ready for the Architect to review and create specifications.
