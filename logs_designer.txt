I'll help you generate a new feature idea. Let me first check the trajectory.md file and see what's already in the 0_ideas/ directory.

I can see that the trajectory.md file exists with many features described, and some are marked as selected, but the 0_ideas/ directory is empty. Let me choose a feature from trajectory.md that hasn't been marked as selected yet.

I'll select **"Functional Transformations and Vectorization"** from Section 2.2. This is a core feature that includes automatic vectorization (vmap), parallelization (pmap), and JIT compilation - all critical for a modern ML framework.

Perfect! I've successfully created **ONE new feature idea file** in `0_ideas/`:

**File Created:** `0_ideas/functional_transformations.md`

This feature covers **Functional Transformations and Vectorization** from trajectory.md Section 2.2, including:
- **Vectorization (vmap)** - automatic batching transformations
- **Parallelization (pmap/shard_map)** - SPMD device parallelism
- **Just-In-Time Compilation (jit)** - tracing and optimization
- **Function Composition** - building complex computations from pure functions

I've also updated `trajectory.md` to mark this section as completed with the reference to the new file.

Task complete. Stopping immediately.
