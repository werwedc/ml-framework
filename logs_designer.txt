I'll help you generate a new feature idea. Let me first check if there's a trajectory.md file with existing feature ideas.

[96m[1m| [0m[90m Read     [0mtrajectory.mdNow let me check what feature ideas already exist in the `0_ideas/` directory:
[94m[1m| [0m[90m Glob     [0m{"pattern":"0_ideas/*.md"}
I can see the trajectory.md file has many features listed. Several are marked as selected (with ✓), but there's still a `0_ideas/` directory that needs to be populated. Let me create a new feature idea file for **Communication Primitives**, which is a critical feature for distributed training that hasn't been selected yet.
[92m[1m| [0m[90m Write    [0m0_ideas\communication_primitives.md
Now I need to update trajectory.md to mark this feature as selected:
[96m[1m| [0m[90m Read     [0mtrajectory.md
[92m[1m| [0m[90m Edit     [0mtrajectory.md
Done! I've created a new feature idea file in `0_ideas/communication_primitives.md` and marked it as selected in trajectory.md.

The feature covers **Communication Primitives** for distributed training, which includes:
- Core collective operations (Broadcast, AllReduce, Reduce, etc.)
- Backend abstraction for NCCL, RCCL, and MPI
- Asynchronous operations to overlap communication with computation
- Point-to-point communication
- Process group management
- Performance optimizations and fault tolerance

This is a foundational feature that will enable the framework to support data parallelism, model parallelism, and other distributed training strategies.
