I'll help you generate ONE new feature idea in `0_ideas/`. Let me first check if there's a `trajectory.md` file to see what features might be planned, then create the idea file.

I can see the `trajectory.md` file contains a comprehensive roadmap. I notice that several features have already been selected (marked with ✓), but there are many important features remaining. Let me create a new feature idea for **Tensor Parallelism**, which is a critical feature for large model training that hasn't been selected yet.

✅ **Task Complete!**

I've created a new feature idea file: **`0_ideas/tensor_parallelism.md`**

This feature focuses on **Tensor Parallelism (TP)** - a critical model parallelism technique that splits individual tensors (like large matrix multiplications) across multiple devices. This is essential for training models with layers that exceed single GPU memory capacity, such as large language models with massive embedding and projection layers.

The feature idea includes:
- Column and Row parallelism implementations
- Automatic communication injection (all-reduce, all-gather)
- Drop-in replacement for standard Linear layers
- Integration with 3D parallelism (combining with DDP and FSDP)
- Memory efficiency for massive models

I've also updated `trajectory.md` to mark this feature as selected with a ✓ note.
