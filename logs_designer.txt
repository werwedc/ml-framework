I'll help you generate a new feature idea. Let me first check the trajectory.md file to see if there are any features to pick from, and then explore the existing ideas folder.

I'll generate a new feature idea based on the trajectory.md file. I can see that **Checkpointing (Activation Recomputation)** is mentioned on line 42 but is NOT marked as selected. This is a critical feature for training large models. Let me create the feature idea file for this.

Perfect! I've successfully created a new feature idea file:

**Created:** `0_ideas/activation_checkpointing.md`

This feature addresses **Activation Checkpointing (Gradient Checkpointing)**, which was identified in `trajectory.md` but was not yet marked as selected. The feature is critical for:

- Training large models that exceed GPU memory constraints
- Reducing memory usage by 50-90% through strategic activation recomputation
- Enabling larger batch sizes and deeper networks on available hardware
- Supporting training of state-of-the-art large language models

I've also updated `trajectory.md` to mark this feature as "FEATURE SELECTED" with the appropriate note.

The file includes comprehensive specifications covering:
- Core mechanism and checkpointing strategies
- API design with C# examples
- Technical specifications (memory savings, computation overhead)
- Use cases (LLMs, edge devices, research)
- Advanced features (selective checkpointing, gradient accumulation)
- Testing strategy and success metrics
