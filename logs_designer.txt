I'll help you create a new feature idea in `0_ideas/`. Let me first check the trajectory.md file to see what features are available, then create one feature idea file.

I can see the trajectory.md file contains comprehensive information about ML framework features. Let me create ONE new feature idea file. I'll select the **Quantization Ecosystem** feature from section 6.2, which includes Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) and Quantization Aware Training (QAT).

Now I'll mark this feature as selected in trajectory.md:

Done! I've created ONE new feature idea file:

**`0_ideas/quantization_ecosystem.md`** - A comprehensive feature covering the Quantization Ecosystem including:
- Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) with both Dynamic and Static quantization
- Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) with fake quantization nodes
- Calibration strategies and accuracy evaluation tools
- Flexible quantization configuration API
- Backend support for x86, ARM, and GPU
- Benefits including 4x model size reduction and 2-4x inference speedup

I've also marked this feature as selected in trajectory.md at line 144.
