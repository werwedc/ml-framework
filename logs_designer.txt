I'll help you generate one new feature idea in `0_ideas/`. Let me first check the `trajectory.md` file and see what's already in the `0_ideas/` directory.

Looking at trajectory.md, I can see several features are already marked as selected and in progress. The `0_ideas/` directory is currently empty, which suggests those files have been moved forward. 

I'll select a new feature from trajectory.md that hasn't been implemented yet: **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) with LoRA** from Section 6.3. This is a critical modern feature for adapting large foundation models without full retraining.

Let me create this new feature idea file:

Now let me mark this feature as selected in trajectory.md:

✓ **Task Complete**

I've created **exactly one** new feature idea file in `0_ideas/`:

**`parameter_efficient_finetuning_lora.md`** - Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning with LoRA

This feature implements Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) technology, which is essential for modern ML frameworks. It enables:
- **99.5% reduction** in trainable parameters for large language models
- **Multi-tenancy**: Multiple fine-tuned adapters can be loaded and switched at runtime
- **Extreme memory efficiency**: Fine-tune 7B+ parameter models on consumer GPUs
- **Zero inference overhead**: After merging adapters, no computational penalty

The feature has been marked as selected in `trajectory.md` (Section 6.3). This is a production-critical feature for foundation model fine-tuning and aligns with the project's goal of building a comprehensive ML framework.
