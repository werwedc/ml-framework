I'll help you create a new feature idea in `0_ideas/`. Let me first check if there's a `trajectory.md` file to see what features might be suggested there.

I can see that trajectory.md contains many features that are all marked as already selected (with `[✓ FEATURE SELECTED - Implementation in progress]`). Since all the features in trajectory.md are already being implemented, I'll create a new feature idea that isn't covered there.

Let me create a feature idea for **Learning Rate Schedulers**, which is a critical component for training convergence that's not mentioned in the trajectory.md file.

I've successfully created a new feature idea file: `0_ideas/learning_rate_schedulers.md`

This feature focuses on **Learning Rate Schedulers**, which is a critical component for effective deep learning training that wasn't covered in the existing trajectory.md. The file includes:

- **Core scheduling strategies**: Step decay, multi-step, exponential, cosine annealing, one-cycle policy, cyclic LR, and reduce-on-plateau
- **Warmup mechanisms**: Essential for stabilizing early training, especially for large batches and transformer models
- **Composition and chaining**: Combining multiple schedulers for complex training regimes
- **Integration points**: Seamless integration with optimizers, training loops, and callbacks
- **Advanced features**: Layer-wise decay, discriminative fine-tuning, and per-parameter scheduling

This is a production-grade feature that will significantly improve the framework's training capabilities and developer experience.
