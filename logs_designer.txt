I'll help you generate a new feature idea in the `0_ideas/` directory. Let me first explore the existing structure and check trajectory.md.

I can see the `0_ideas/` directory is empty. Looking at `trajectory.md`, I found an unselected feature in **Section 9 (MLOps Integration and Ecosystem)**. 

I'll create a feature idea for **Reproducibility** - a critical component for deterministic training runs.

Now I'll update `trajectory.md` to mark this feature as selected:

✅ Created feature idea file: `0_ideas/deterministic_reproducibility.md`

This feature provides a comprehensive system for ensuring reproducible training runs by:
- Centralized seeding of all RNGs (Python, NumPy, CUDA, cuDNN)
- Deterministic mode enforcement across the framework
- RNG state capture/restore for exact checkpointing
- Validation and diagnostics for deterministic behavior
- Scoped determinism via context managers

The feature has been marked as selected in `trajectory.md` (Section 9: MLOps Integration and Ecosystem).
