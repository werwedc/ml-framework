I'll help you create a new feature idea file. Let me first check if there's a trajectory.md file with feature suggestions and examine the 0_ideas/ directory structure.

I'll create a new feature idea file. Looking at trajectory.md, I can see there are many features available. I'll select "Distributed Checkpointing" from section 4.2, which is a critical feature for large-scale model training that hasn't been selected yet.

Now let me mark this feature as selected in trajectory.md:

[92m[1m| [0m[90m Edit     [0mtrajectory.mdDone! I've created a new feature idea file for **Distributed Checkpointing** at `0_ideas/distributed_checkpointing.md`.

This feature addresses the critical need to save and restore the complete state of models that are sharded across multiple GPUs during distributed training. Key aspects include:

- **Sharded State Management**: Automatically detect and collect sharded model parameters, gradients, and optimizer states
- **Cross-Topology Resilience**: Save from N GPUs and load onto M GPUs with automatic re-sharding
- **Distributed Write Coordination**: Rank 0 orchestration with atomic commit protocol
- **Multiple Checkpoint Formats**: Single-file, multi-shard, consolidated, and streaming formats
- **Fault Tolerance**: Validation checks, rollback capability, and retry logic

The feature is essential for training massive models (trillions of parameters) using strategies like FSDP and Tensor Parallelism, enabling training resumption, model serving, and experiment branching.

I've also marked this feature as selected in `trajectory.md` (line 116).
