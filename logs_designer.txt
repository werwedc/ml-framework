I'll help you generate ONE new feature idea. Let me first check if there's a trajectory.md file to see what features might be available.

I'll create a feature idea file for **Fully Sharded Data Parallelism (FSDP)**. This is a critical feature for training large models that don't fit on a single GPU. Let me write this to `0_ideas/fsdp_sharding.md`.

Done! I've created **ONE** new feature idea file: `0_ideas/fsdp_sharding.md` for **Fully Sharded Data Parallelism (FSDP)**.

This feature enables training of large models that exceed single GPU memory by sharding parameters, gradients, and optimizer states across all devices (inspired by ZeRO optimization). The document covers:

- Core sharding strategies (parameters, gradients, optimizer states)
- API design with seamless integration
- Advanced features like CPU offloading and mixed precision
- Implementation phases and testing strategy

I've also updated `trajectory.md` to mark this feature as selected.
