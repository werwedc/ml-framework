^CI'll create ONE new feature idea file in `0_ideas/`. Let me first check the directory structure and then create the file.

✓ Created feature idea file: `0_ideas/mixed_precision_optimizer.md`

The file proposes a **Mixed-Precision Training Optimizer** that automatically manages FP16/BF16 and FP32 tensor operations for accelerated training while maintaining numerical stability. This is a valuable feature for modern ML frameworks that can provide:

- 2-3x training speedup on compatible hardware
- 40-50% reduction in GPU memory usage
- Support for larger batch sizes and model architectures

The proposal includes detailed architecture design, API specifications, implementation details, and risk mitigations.
I'll help you generate a new feature idea. Let me first check if there's a `trajectory.md` file to see if there are any features I should work on.

I'll check the `trajectory.md` file which contains comprehensive feature ideas for a machine learning framework. Let me pick one feature and create a detailed idea file for it.

Based on trajectory.md, I'll create a feature idea for **Automatic Differentiation (Autograd)**, which is fundamental to any ML framework (Section 2.3). This will focus on higher-order derivatives, custom autograd functions, and gradient checkpointing.

Now let me mark this feature as completed in trajectory.md:

Perfect! I've created a new feature idea file for the **Automatic Differentiation (Autograd) Engine** in `0_ideas/autograd_engine.md`.

This feature includes:
- **Automatic Gradient Tracking** - Dynamic computational graph construction
- **Higher-Order Derivatives** - Jacobians, Hessians for advanced optimization
- **Gradient Checkpointing** - Memory-efficient training for large models
- **Custom Autograd Functions** - User-defined backward passes for custom operations

I've also marked this section (2.3) as selected in `trajectory.md` with a completion note.

The feature idea is ready for the Architect to review and create the specification.
