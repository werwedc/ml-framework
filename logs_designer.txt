I'll help you generate ONE new feature idea in `0_ideas/`. Let me first check if there's a trajectory.md file to see what features might be planned.

[94m[1m| [0m[90m Glob     [0m{"pattern":"0_ideas/*.md"}I'll generate ONE new feature idea file. Looking at trajectory.md, I can see it mentions "Model Versioning and Hot-Swapping" for serving architecture, but it doesn't have an explicit file marker. I'll create a feature idea file for this critical serving capability.

✅ **Feature idea created successfully!**

I've created a new feature idea file:
- **File**: `0_ideas/model_versioning_hotswapping.md`
- **Topic**: Model Versioning and Hot-Swapping for production ML serving

This feature addresses critical production serving capabilities including:
- Semantic versioning and model registry
- Multi-version serving with traffic routing
- A/B testing and canary deployments
- Zero-downtime hot-swapping
- Per-version monitoring and observability

I've also updated `trajectory.md` to mark this feature as selected with an implementation in progress marker.

Task complete - stopping immediately.
