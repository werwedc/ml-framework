I'll help you generate a new feature idea. Let me first check if there's a trajectory.md file to see what features might be available, then create one new feature idea in the `0_ideas/` directory.

I can see the trajectory.md file contains many features, and several are marked as selected. Let me pick a feature that hasn't been implemented yet and create an idea file for it. 

Looking through the trajectory, I notice that **Higher-Order Derivatives** (lines 36-37) is not marked as selected and is important for the framework's Autograd engine. This is a critical feature for advanced optimization algorithms and scientific computing applications.

Now I need to mark this feature as selected in the trajectory.md file:
[92m[1m| [0m[90m Edit     [0mtrajectory.md
Perfect! I've successfully created a new feature idea file in the `0_ideas/` directory:

**Created:** `0_ideas/higher_order_derivatives.md`

This feature implements support for higher-order derivatives (Jacobians, Hessians) in the automatic differentiation engine, which is critical for:
- Advanced optimization algorithms (Newton's method, natural gradient)
- Meta-learning (MAML)
- Scientific computing applications involving differential equations

I've also marked this feature as selected in `trajectory.md` to track progress. The implementation includes:

1. **Jacobian computation** with forward/reverse mode AD
2. **Hessian computation** with efficient Hessian-vector products
3. **Higher-order gradients** for arbitrary derivative orders
4. **Memory-efficient strategies** for large models
5. **API design** with clean C# interfaces

The task is now complete - exactly one new feature idea file has been created in `0_ideas/`.
