I'll help you process the pending idea in 0_ideas/. Let me start by checking what's there.

Now I'll break down this Distributed Data Parallelism idea into multiple small, atomic technical specs. Each spec will represent ~30-60 minutes of human coding work.

Perfect! I've successfully broken down the Distributed Data Parallelism idea into 10 atomic technical specs, each representing ~30-60 minutes of human coding work. Let me now delete the original idea file from 0_ideas/ as instructed.

## Task Complete! ✅

I've successfully processed the pending Distributed Data Parallelism idea from `0_ideas/` and broken it down into **10 atomic technical specs** in `1_specs/`, each representing ~30-60 minutes of human coding work:

### Created Specs:

1. **spec_communication_backend_interface.md** - Communication abstraction layer (interfaces for AllReduce, Broadcast, Barrier)

2. **spec_process_group.md** - Core process group management (rank/world_size tracking, initialization)

3. **spec_ring_allreduce.md** - Ring-AllReduce algorithm implementation (gradient synchronization)

4. **spec_distributed_sampler.md** - Distributed dataset sampler (data partitioning, shuffling)

5. **spec_gradient_bucketing.md** - Gradient bucketing optimization (performance improvement)

6. **spec_ddp_module.md** - DistributedDataParallel module wrapper (high-level API)

7. **spec_nccl_backend.md** - NCCL backend implementation (NVIDIA GPU communication)

8. **spec_gloo_backend.md** - Gloo backend implementation (CPU/cross-platform communication)

9. **spec_process_launcher.md** - Multi-process launching mechanism (manage distributed processes)

10. **spec_ddp_tests.md** - Comprehensive test suite (unit tests, integration tests, mocks)

### Original File:
✅ **DELETED**: `0_ideas/distributed_data_parallelism.md`

All specs are now ready for the Coder to implement! Each spec is:
- Atomic and implementable in a single execution
- Self-contained with clear requirements and success criteria
- Properly ordered with dependencies documented
- Includes comprehensive testing requirements
