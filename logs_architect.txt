I'll process the pending idea in the `0_ideas/` directory. Let me first check what files are there.

Now I'll break down this Pipeline Parallelism feature into multiple small, atomic technical specs. Each spec will be designed for 30-60 minutes of implementation work.

Perfect! I've successfully broken down the Pipeline Parallelism feature into **10 atomic technical specs**, each designed for 30-60 minutes of implementation work:

## Specs Created:

1. **spec_pipeline_stage_core.md** - Core data structures (PipelineStage, PipelineConfig)
2. **spec_pipeline_partitioning.md** - Layer partitioning algorithms (auto/manual/uniform)
3. **spec_pipeline_communication.md** - Communication interface (IPipelineCommunicator, LocalPipelineCommunicator)
4. **spec_microbatch_manager.md** - Micro-batching and gradient accumulation
5. **spec_scheduler_gpipe.md** - GPipe scheduling (1F1B strategy)
6. **spec_activation_checkpoint.md** - Activation checkpointing for memory optimization
7. **spec_pipeline_optimizer.md** - Optimizer integration with gradient synchronization
8. **spec_pipeline_async_execution.md** - Async execution with CUDA streams
9. **spec_pipeline_validation.md** - Validation, consistency checking, and error handling
10. **spec_pipeline_tests.md** - Comprehensive test suite

Each spec includes:
- Class designs with C# code
- Implementation requirements
- Testing requirements
- Dependencies
- Time estimates

Now I'll delete the original file from `0_ideas/`:

✅ **Task Complete!**

I've successfully processed the pending idea from `0_ideas/` and broken it down into **10 atomic technical specs** in `1_specs/`:

### Summary of Specs Created:

1. **spec_pipeline_stage_core.md** - Core data structures (30-45 min)
2. **spec_pipeline_partitioning.md** - Layer partitioning algorithms (45-60 min)
3. **spec_pipeline_communication.md** - Communication interface (30-45 min)
4. **spec_microbatch_manager.md** - Micro-batching (30-45 min)
5. **spec_scheduler_gpipe.md** - GPipe 1F1B scheduling (45-60 min)
6. **spec_activation_checkpoint.md** - Checkpointing (30-45 min)
7. **spec_pipeline_optimizer.md** - Optimizer integration (45-60 min)
8. **spec_pipeline_async_execution.md** - Async execution (45-60 min)
9. **spec_pipeline_validation.md** - Validation (30-45 min)
10. **spec_pipeline_tests.md** - Test suite (60-90 min)

Each spec:
- Represents 30-60 minutes of human coding work
- Is atomic and implementable in a single execution
- Includes class designs, implementation requirements, testing requirements, and dependencies
- Follows C# conventions and the existing ML framework architecture

The specs are now ready for the Coder to implement!
