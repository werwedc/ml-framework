I'll help you process the pending idea in 0_ideas/. Let me start by reading the AGENTS.md file and then exploring the 0_ideas/ directory.

Now let me read the idea file to understand what needs to be broken down:

Now I'll break this idea into multiple small, atomic technical specs. Let me create the specs:

Now I'll delete the original idea file since all specs have been created:

Perfect! I've successfully processed the pending idea in `0_ideas/` and broken it down into **8 atomic technical specs** in `1_specs/`:

## Created Specs:

1. **spec_shape_mismatch_exception.md** - Custom exception class with rich diagnostic properties
2. **spec_operation_metadata_registry.md** - Registry for operation shape requirements and validation rules
3. **spec_shape_inference_engine.md** - Shape inference without actual execution
4. **spec_diagnostics_api.md** - Public API (EnableDiagnostics, CheckShapes, GetShapeDiagnostics)
5. **spec_error_reporting_core.md** - Error context capture and integration with tensor operations
6. **spec_formatted_diagnostic_report.md** - Text, HTML, and JSON report formatters
7. **spec_operation_specific_diagnostics.md** - Specialized handlers for MatrixMultiply, Conv2D, Concat, etc.
8. **spec_diagnostics_tests.md** - Comprehensive unit and integration test suites

Each spec represents approximately **30-60 minutes** of coding work and includes:
- Clear requirements with C# code examples
- Specific deliverables (file paths in `src/` and `tests/`)
- Testing requirements with detailed test cases
- Implementation notes

The original idea file has been deleted from `0_ideas/` as required. The Coder can now implement these specs in any order to build the complete shape mismatch error reporting system.
