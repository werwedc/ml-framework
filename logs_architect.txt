Perfect! I've read the idea file for the Intermediate Representations (IR) system. This is a comprehensive multi-stage IR compiler infrastructure. Now I'll break this down into multiple small, atomic technical specs, each representing ~30-60 minutes of coding work.

Let me create the specs in `1_specs/`:

[92m[1m| [0m[90m Write    [0m1_specs\spec_llir_foundation.md
Now let me create the remaining specs to complete the IR system implementation:

Perfect! I've successfully broken down the Intermediate Representations (IR) idea into 12 atomic technical specs, each representing approximately 30-60 minutes of coding work. Now let me delete the original idea file as instructed:

Excellent! I've successfully processed the pending idea in `0_ideas/` and broken it down into **12 atomic technical specs** in `1_specs/`. Here's what I've delivered:

## Created Specs:

1. **spec_ir_type_system.md** - Core type system (TensorType, IIRType, IRValue, IROperation base classes)
2. **spec_hlir_operations.md** - High-Level IR operations (Add, MatMul, Conv2D, Pooling, Reductions, Control Flow)
3. **spec_hlir_graph_builder.md** - Graph structure and builder API (IRBlock, HLIRFunction, HLIRModule, HLIRBuilder)
4. **spec_ir_transformation_infra.md** - Transformation infrastructure (IRTransformation, LoweringPassBase, PassManager, OperationRewriter)
5. **spec_hlir_basic_optimizations.md** - Basic HLIR optimization passes (ConstantFolding, DCE, CSE, Simplification)
6. **spec_mlir_operations.md** - Mid-Level IR operations (Broadcast-aware ops, explicit memory, loops, normalized operations)
7. **spec_hlir_to_mlir_lowering.md** - HLIR → MLIR lowering (decomposition, broadcast handling, normalization)
8. **spec_ir_printer_debugger.md** - IR inspection utilities (TextIRPrinter, IRDebugger, ASCII visualizer)
9. **spec_llir_foundation.md** - Low-Level IR foundation (memory ops, scalar/vector ops, SSA form, phi nodes)
10. **spec_backend_abstraction.md** - Backend layer (IBackend, CPU/GPU backends, BackendRegistry, Compilation)
11. **spec_mlir_to_llir_lowering.md** - MLIR → LLIR lowering (explicit memory, loop generation, address computation)
12. **spec_ir_unit_tests.md** - Comprehensive test suite for all IR components

## Summary:

✅ **Original idea deleted** from `0_ideas/intermediate_representations_ir.md`

📋 **Each spec** is designed for ~30-60 minutes of focused coding work

🏗️ **Complete coverage** of the multi-stage IR system:
- Type system & abstractions
- 3 IR levels (HLIR → MLIR → LLIR)
- Optimization passes
- Lowering infrastructure
- Backend abstraction
- Debugging tools
- Unit tests

The specs follow the Factory Protocols and are ready for the Coder to implement. All code will go into `src/IR/` and tests into `tests/IR/`.
