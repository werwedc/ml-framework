I'll help you process the pending idea in 0_ideas/. Let me start by reading the AGENTS.md file and then checking what's in the 0_ideas/ directory.

Perfect! I found a comprehensive idea about implementing dynamic shapes support. Now I'll break this down into multiple atomic technical specs, each representing ~30-60 minutes of coding work.

Let me create the spec files:

Excellent! I've successfully broken down the dynamic shapes idea into 14 atomic technical specs. Let me now delete the original file from 0_ideas/ as required:

Perfect! I've successfully processed the pending idea in `0_ideas/` and broken it down into 14 atomic technical specs in `1_specs/`. Here's a summary:

## Completed Work

**Original File Deleted:** `0_ideas/dynamic_shapes.md`

**Created 14 Technical Specs:**

1. **spec_symbolic_dimension.md** - Core symbolic dimension class with name, value, and constraints
2. **spec_shape_constraint.md** - Constraint system for symbolic dimensions
3. **spec_symbolic_shape.md** - Shape representation using symbolic dimensions
4. **spec_shape_inference_engine.md** - Base shape inference engine for operations
5. **spec_static_shape_checker.md** - Early detection of shape incompatibilities
6. **spec_symbolic_tensor_api.md** - User-facing API for symbolic tensors
7. **spec_kernel_cache.md** - Kernel caching by shape signature
8. **spec_lazy_compilation.md** - On-demand kernel compilation
9. **spec_memory_allocator_dynamic.md** - Predictive memory allocation
10. **spec_shape_profiler.md** - Track shape distributions
11. **spec_broadcasting_symbolic.md** - Broadcasting with symbolic dimensions
12. **spec_autograd_dynamic_shapes.md** - Autograd engine updates
13. **spec_operator_fusion_dynamic.md** - Fusion preserving shape dynamics
14. **spec_gradient_accumulation_dynamic.md** - Gradient accumulation with variable batches

## Key Design Decisions

Each spec:
- Represents **~30-60 minutes** of human coding work
- Is **implementable independently** by the Coder
- Has **clear requirements**, **unit tests**, **dependencies**, and **success criteria**
- Follows **immutable design** where appropriate
- Includes **comprehensive error handling** and **validation**

The specs are ready for the Coder to implement in `src/` and `tests/` directories, following the Git workflow specified in AGENTS.md.
