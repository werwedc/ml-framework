## Summary

I've successfully processed the pending idea from `0_ideas/` and broken it down into **10 atomic technical specs** in `1_specs/`. Each spec represents ~30-60 minutes of human coding work:

### Created Specs:

1. **spec_gradient_tape_extension.md** - Extend gradient tape for multiple differentiation passes and higher-order gradient tracking

2. **spec_vjp_implementation.md** - Vector-Jacobian product (VJP) using reverse-mode automatic differentiation

3. **spec_jvp_implementation.md** - Jacobian-vector product (JVP) using forward-mode automatic differentiation with dual numbers

4. **spec_jacobian_full.md** - Full Jacobian computation with automatic mode selection, sparse support, and structure detection

5. **spec_hvp_implementation.md** - Hessian-vector product (HVP) without materializing full Hessian, using Pearlmutter's trick

6. **spec_hessian_full.md** - Full Hessian computation with symmetry exploitation, sparse support, and eigenvalue computation

7. **spec_higher_order_api.md** - User-friendly API design with context-based and functional APIs, configuration options, and validation

8. **spec_optimizer_integration.md** - Integration with existing optimizers including Newton's method, L-BFGS, natural gradient, and Hessian-aware Adam

9. **spec_examples_tutorials.md** - Comprehensive examples covering MAML, Newton's method, Neural ODEs, sharpness minimization, and adversarial robustness

10. **spec_higher_order_tests.md** - Complete unit test suite with correctness tests, performance benchmarks, and integration tests

### Original File Deleted:
- ✅ `0_ideas/higher_order_derivatives.md` has been removed

All specs are now ready for the **Coder** to implement. Each spec includes:
- Clear requirements and API design
- Technical implementation details
- Phased implementation tasks
- Comprehensive testing requirements
- Dependencies and success criteria
- Notes for the Coder
